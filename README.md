# Team Treehouse Project 2
## Pagination & Filtering

This project takes a long list of student names and dynamically paginates them, regardless of how long the original list is.

My starter files were `index.html` and the various css files (`44students.html` and `64students.html` were also included as test files).

I added my own `custom.css` file to enable highlighting in the search, and I wrote the entirety of `scripts.js`.
